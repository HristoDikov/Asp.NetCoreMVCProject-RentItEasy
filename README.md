# RentItEasy
1. If you are an agency you can create an agency profile and add all your apartments for rent, if anyone is interested in any of your apartments he can book a free date to view the apartment.
2. If you are a person looking for his new place to live, you can view all the apartments in the site. When you like one just book a date and time for a meeting with the agency.
